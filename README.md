# SLMN.GG

This repo houses the server and Vue website for SLMN.GG. The latest commit to master is live at [dev.slmn.gg](https://dev.slmn.gg).

## Developing

To develop, you'll need to run both the server and website build. Check out the `serve-server` and `serve-website` scripts in the package.jsons.

You will also need to copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and provide your own Airtable base and key. 
At the moment, there is no way to get the actual SLMN.GG dataset (nor a schema to copy your own). Access may be granted in certain circumstances.

## Bugs and feature requests

If you find a bug, please [create an issue](https://github.com/slmnio/slmngg-sfc/issues/new) with as much detail as possible. 

Feature requests should probably be discussed in the #slmngg-requests channel in the BPL Discord server, but afterwards you can create an issue with the details from those conversations.
