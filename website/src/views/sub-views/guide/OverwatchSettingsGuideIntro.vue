        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your Overwatch settings for the best possible
            performance and experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Account- and File-Settings</h3>
        <p>
            There are two different types of Overwatch settings: <strong><i class="fa fa-user mx-1"></i> Account
            Settings</strong> and <strong><i class="fa fa-file mx-1"></i> File Settings</strong>.
            We'll highlight which settings are account-based and which are file-based using these icons.
        </p>

        <h3>Automatic Settings</h3>
        <p>
            We have <a href="/tools/ow-settings" target="_blank">a tool</a> that can automatically load the file-based
            settings for you. It'll also automatically backup your current settings which you can restore at any time by
            visiting the tool again. Automatic settings are marked with <i class="fa fa-sparkles mx-1"></i>.
