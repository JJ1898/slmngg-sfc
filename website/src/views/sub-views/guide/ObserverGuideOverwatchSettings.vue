            Configuring Overwatch
        </h2>
        <p>
            There are two different types of Overwatch settings: <strong>Account Settings</strong> and <strong>File
            Settings</strong>.
            We have a tool to automatically load the system-based settings for you. For account-based settings, you'll
            need to manually configure them (this is where a second account comes in handy).
        </p>

        <h3>
            File Settings
        </h3>

        <p>
            Use <a href="/tools/ow-settings" target="_blank">our tool</a> to automatically load the settings for you.
            It'll <strong>automatically backup</strong> your current settings which you can restore at any time by
            visiting the tool again.
        </p>

        <p>TODO elaborate what it does, especially margins</p>

        <h4>Account Settings</h4>

        <p>
            You'll need to manually configure your account settings. Go here for a full list of all settings we use at BPL.
            Settings changed by the tool are marked with a <strong><i class="fa fa-sparkles"></i> </strong>.
