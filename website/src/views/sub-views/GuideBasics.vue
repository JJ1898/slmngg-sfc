    <h3>OBS</h3>
    <p>
      Download OBS Studio <a href="https://obsproject.com/download">here</a>. <strong>DO NOT USE STREAMLABS
      DESKTOP!</strong>
    </p>

    <h3>Internet</h3>
    <p>
      You need a good quality internet connection to stream your gameplay. If you have less than 10mbps upload, you
      aren't going to be able to stream at high quality. If you're not sure about that, take a speedtest and send it to
      production staff.

    <h3>Observing Account</h3>
    <p>
      It's useful to have an extra Overwatch account for observing. If you have a spare account, you can reset its
      settings and use it.
      If you don't, you'll need a phone number to create a new account due to Overwatch 2's SMS verification. You can
      also use your main account but you'll need to reset its settings.
